The idea of this gitrepo is twofolded:
	- have a directory containing all the glassy configurations in where a single ML model can predict the qs for all the pairs  
	- keep in the same directory the NEB calculations that will be automatically used by the ML model to increse its predictive power 

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________


To achieve those goals a rigorous organization of the data are required.

In particular all the minima for different glasses and configurations will be organized as:
	Configurations/minima/T{T_i}/Cnf-{xxx}/{energy_i}.conf.txt

Then the NEB calculations used to train the ML model have to respect this structure: 
	NEB_calculations/T{T_i}/NON-DW.txt   		(list of non DW)
	NEB_calculations/T{T_i}/Qs_calcuations.txt 	(list of calculated Qs)

The ML model which is contained in the MLmodel directory will be able to do two things:
	[a] predict the qs for all the pairs generated from Configurations/* 
	[b] retrain itself using the data in NEB_calculations/*

Its output will be the following:
	output_ML/T{T_i}/predictedQs_T{T_i}.csv 	(list of predicted Qs)
	output_ML/T{T_i}/nonDW_T{T_i}.csv 	(list of non DW)



_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________



So the general idea is to do the following:
(1) collect new data  
(2) run [a] 
(3) for the best X pairs of (2) run the NEB
(4) (optional) run [b]
(5) either go to (1) or (3)
